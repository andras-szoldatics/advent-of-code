# Advent of Code

These are my attempts at solving the new (& old) challenges of the yearly [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) event.

The solutions are organized in a subfolder structure: ```./{YEAR}/{DAY}```

So far, each solution is a single CMAKE project using C++17 as a coding standard.

Each project provides solutions to both the first & the second part of the day's challenge.
