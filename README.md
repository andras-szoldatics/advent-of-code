# Advent of Code

These are my attempts of solving the new (& old) challenges of the yearly [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) event.

The solutions are organized in a subfolder structure: ```./{YEAR}/{DAY}```

Each solution is a single CMAKE project using C++17 as coding standard, solving first & second part of the day's challenge.
