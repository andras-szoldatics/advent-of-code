# Advent of Code

These are my attempts at solving the new (& old) challenges of the yearly [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) event.

The solutions are organized in a subfolder structure: ```./{YEAR}/{DAY}```

So far, each solution is a single CMAKE project using C++17 as a coding standard.

Each project provides solutions to both the first & the second part of the day's challenge.

## input data for challenges

Per the creator's request, input files are not included in this repo.

If you want to test your input, this requires creating an ```input.txt``` file in the working directory. Usually.
